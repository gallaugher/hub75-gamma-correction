Sample code to quickly compare an image loaded on a 64x32 HUB75 display connected to a Raspberry Pi Pico.
Modify the code accordingly if you have different display dimensions or a different board.
I've swapped image that says:
"blinka-corrected.bmp"
vs.
"blinka-original.bmp"
to compare the differences in gamma correction.
A lesson on how to use GIMP to gamma correct HUB75 LEDs can be found in:

Simply save with Colors > Levels. Then set the central box to 0.4 (circled below)
